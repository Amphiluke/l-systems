# L-systems

![Median dragon](https://amphiluke.github.io/l-systems/img/dragon.png)

A simple canvas-based [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) plotter and manager created just for the fun of it. Please visit the project [web-page](https://amphiluke.github.io/l-systems/) to play with the app online (*use a browser with [ES6 support](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)!*).

There are a few of L-system collections built in the app for demonstration purposes. These L-systems were gathered from various sources including the web, books, and articles. I appreciate the [authors](src/lib/README.MD) of these L-systems.

The app interface also allows you to create your own L-system collections and even share hyperlinks to your favourite L-systems with your friends.
