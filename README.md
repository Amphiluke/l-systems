# L-systems

![Median dragon](https://amphiluke.github.io/l-systems/img/dragon.png)

Simple SVG-based [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) plotter and manager created just for the fun of it. The app uses [lindsvg](https://github.com/Amphiluke/lindsvg) under the hood. Please visit the project [web-page](https://amphiluke.github.io/l-systems/) to play with the app online (*use a browser supporting the syntax of ECMAScript 2018 and ECMAScript modules!*).

There are [a few L-system collections](src/js/bank.js) built in the app for demonstration purposes. These L-systems were gathered from various sources including the web, books, and articles. I appreciate the authors of these L-systems.

The app interface also allows you to create your own L-system collections and even share hyperlinks to your favourite L-systems with your friends.
